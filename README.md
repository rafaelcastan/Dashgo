This is a project created by Rocketseat, using React and Next, in this application we have developed a dashboard, user list and login page.

The main objective for this app development was to learn about chakra-ui, data fetching and cache local using React Query.


When you access the project through browser the first screen will be the login page:


![login-page](https://i.ibb.co/jHyhnhx/Captura-de-tela-de-2022-01-05-13-50-02.png)

Since the login page is static, and don't do anything, to access dashboard and users list you have to add the paths /dashboard or /users in browser:

### /dashboard

### /users
